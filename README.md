# Indian Grocery Store 

### Reason to select
Nowadays due to covid-19 many people are facing issues in their daily grocery shopping.
So as student of computer programmer I want to help them using technologies.
Also for me it would be a good challange to setup the products range and brands into database and create a application in C#.
That's why I have accepted the challenge to make this and learn more about C#.


### How OOP principles (Abstraction/Polymorphism/Inheritance/Encapsulation) are considered. 
1. Inheritence is the key concept for my project. I have created a Brand and Categeory and then inherited Products from those two.
2. Abstraction is used to create a base implemantation for the actual implementation classes.In abstraction there is no need to provide details about 
all functions of an object but we implement diffrent functions involved in user operation which creates abstraction.
3. In this project encapsulation principles are used in mechanism of wrapping data in single unit and the hidden data can only be accessed through the methods of current used class.
4. Lastly Polymorphism is used in extending data of parent class to child class as we can also say extending data of superclass to subclass by 
accessing all the methods of superclass.
